//Intuition

//If you add up the first n odd numbers (1 + 3 + 5 + …), you always get n × n.
//If you add up the first n even numbers (2 + 4 + 6 + …), you always get n × (n + 1).
//GCD of 2 number (n²,n.(n+1)) is the highest number with which both numbers are completely divisble. The only number that divides both n² and n × (n + 1) is n itself.
So the final answer would be n.
