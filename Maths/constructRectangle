//both the solutions are correct but the reason why solution 2 beats more than 1 is here we go area -> 1, but in solution 1 we go 1 -> area
//since we need greater width so getting greater width in solution 2 is much easier than solution 1 coz here we aint computing diff
//sol 2 is even exiting quickly than sol 1
